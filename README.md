1. Explain communication concept and strategies.
 - Communication is the change of information from one person to another as learning communication and using it correctly is important for everyone. As in week 3 we did facts and opinion in which all of us were in pair of two and one of us had to read an article and another would listen and try and find out which one was fact and which was opinion. During that activity we learned how being a good listner and a good speaker helps us get better at communicating.
2. Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations.
 - I am still working on my presentation will upload once i am done with it. :sweat:
